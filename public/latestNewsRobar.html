					<h1>Anthony J. Moy</h1>
					<p>
						I cannot thank you enough for working with my wife Katy and I and
						building a beautiful house that we're so proud to call our home. I've
						always heard horror stories from first-time home owners about the
						"stressful" building process and I must say you made it an enjoyable
						and exciting experience for us.

						Katy and I visited several of the other homes you built and they are all
						truly "custom". The attention to detail you possess makes each one
						special and unique. Our house is no different, and I think this
						trademark is something Robar Custom Homes can be very proud
						of. Furthermore, we greatly appreciated your willingness to listen to
						our ideas and make them a reality. Working with you felt more like
						working with a partner than a contractor.

						Every day that we come home we love our house even more. If I
						had to do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks again,
						and good luck on your future projects.
						<br>

						Poth, TX

							Now that our home is built and we are now settled in, I thought this would be a great time to drop you a note to
							express my thanks and appreciation for the outstanding job that you and your team did throughout the process of
							building our home. I am extremely pleased with the finished product. I feel we have a very well constructed home
							with a great floor plan that works for us. It was a pleasurable experience working with you.
							I also want to say what a pleasure it was for me to get to know you and have the opportunity of working with you.
							We were impressed with your dedication, enthusiasm, and patience you bring to your work and offer to your clients.
							We mentioned to you we had a hard deadline to complete our house and close on it. You made an extraordinary
							effort to get it done and we could not have been happier. During the construction of our home and ensuing months
							after the closing you consistently dealt efficiently, effectively, and enthusiastically with any and every concern that
							we raised, no matter how trivial on the one hand or how major on the other hand. The can-do attitude and serviceoriented
							philosophy that you brought to this project made the experience tremendously enjoyable.
							Thank you again for all of your efforts in delivering us a very well built quality home with extraordinary value. If in
							the future any of your other customers are looking for a reference regarding you or your company, please feel free to
							give them a copy of this letter, to have them contact me directly, or to have them visit my house to see your work
							first hand.

								I	want	to	thank	Mr.	Ross	Barrera	for	the	fine	job	he	did	in	building	
								our	dream	retirement	home. Ross	is	an	excellent	contractor	and	
								home	builder.	Ross	became	our	friend	and	treated	us	like	family.
								Ross	continues	to	call	to	check	on	any	issues	we	may	have. He	
								corrected	all	issues	with	our	home	during	the	year	warranty	and	
								after,	because	he	cares	about	his	customers.	Ross	was	receptive	
								to	all	our	wishes	on	changes	made	to	our	house	as	it	was	being	
								built	and	he	even	provided	some	extras	at	no	extra	cost.
								My	wife	and	I	looked	at	many	homes	and	talked	to	many	builders	
								in	the	area	and	decided	to	go	with	Ross	because	he	is	honest,	
								sincere,	and	his	word	is	good	as	gold.
								I	recommend	ROBAR	CONSTRUCTION	AND	ROSS	BARRERA	TO	
								BUILD	YOUR	HOME.
								Ross	also	built	my	son’s	home	in	Abrego	Lake	a	few	months	after	
								he	built	ours.
								Thanks	Ross, Good	Job.
